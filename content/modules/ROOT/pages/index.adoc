In this lab, we will guide you through the process of applying the Rosetta Stone to OpenShift Virtualization.

OpenShift Virtualization is everywhere and has a major influence across our accounts.

The interest level is high, but there is always the unavoidable question: How does it compare to other hypervisors?

Moving beyond installation, configuration, and VM creation, the Rosetta Stone builds a mapping between traditional virtualization platforms and OpenShift Virtualization capabilities.

Let's take that mapping and put it into practice to supercharge your knowledge and tackle those customer questions with confidence.

In this lab, we will introduce and walk you through how to explain and demonstrate key administrative and VM owner capabilities around infrastructure optimization, workload availability, scalability, and resource management.

You will walk away with the understanding, knowledge, and experience to showcase:

* *Live Migration of Workloads:* Move VMs seamlessly between hosts with zero downtime
* *CPU and Memory Overcommit:* Optimize resource utilization across your cluster
* *Hot Plugging of CPU, Memory, and Disk Resources:* Scale VM resources without restarts
* *Affinity and Anti-Affinity for VM Placement:* Control where VMs run for performance and availability
* *Dynamic Rescheduling of Workloads:* Let the platform automatically optimize VM placement
* *Fencing and How to Handle Node Failure:* Ensure workload resilience during infrastructure disruptions
* *Decentralized Live Migration:* How to migrate workloads between namespaces and clusters
* *VM Isolation and Security:* Control where VMs run for performance and availability
