= Decentralized Live Migration

Decentralized live migration is a variation of storage live migration that allows you to migrate virtual machines between namespaces or between different, separated clusters.

This can be useful for a variety of reasons including:

Balancing Workload: Distributing virtual machines between clusters helps optimize resource utilization. If one cluster is heavily loaded while another is idle, rebalancing can significantly improve operational efficiency.

Facilitating Maintenance: For environments with multiple clusters, virtual machine migration allows for seamless maintenance. You can move virtual machines off a cluster slated for upgrades or shutdown, ensuring zero downtime for your services.

Expediting Restores: Instant restore capabilities from backup vendors, particularly when coupled with namespace migration, can drastically speed up recovery times. virtual machines can be quickly restored to a temporary location and then migrated to their original namespace and storage.

This lab demonstrates the forthcoming Tech Preview capabilities of Decentralized Live Migration. In this lab, we will walk through the live migration of a `VirtualMachine` from one `Namespace` to another. The process of live migrating between namespaces follows the same process as if you were to migrate a `VirtualMachine` between 2 clusters.

The UI based workflow is not finished yet. During this lab we will introduce you to the UI workflow, but perform the migration through the CLI.
