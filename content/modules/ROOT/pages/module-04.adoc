= Affinity and Anti-Affinity for VM Placement

This lab is designed to enhance your proficiency in applying Node Affinity, Pod Affinity, and Anti-Pod Affinity specifically to Virtual Machines. The core purpose is to illustrate the practical application of these principles in real-world scenarios and solidify your conceptual understanding.

[#nodeaffinity]
== Node Affinity

Node Affinity defines rules that guide the scheduler to attract a Virtual Machine Pod to a specific node or group of nodes. These rules rely on matching labels applied to the nodes.

The core use case for Node Affinity is to ensure that a VM runs only on nodes that possess specific hardware features, such as a particular GPU model or a high amount of RAM, by matching the corresponding labels on the node.

This lab will demonstrate how Node Affinity is set up and how it functions.

Alternatively you can use the OpenShift Console by going to Compute → Nodes and then pick a node you just label. Then click the 3 dots and click *Edit labels*. Once finished looking click *Save*.

. Navigate to Virtualization → Virtual Machines → node-affinity-vm → Configuration 

+
image::exercise4/04-image-affinity01.png[title="Node Affinity Navigation", link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

+
. Click *Add affinity rule*.

+
image::exercise4/04-image-affinity02a.png[title="Node Affinity add rule", link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

+
. Change the condition to preferred during scheduling and set the weight to 75.
Then, under *Node Labels* click *Add Expression*. Set the *Key* field to *zone* and the *Values* field to *east*, which is the label applied to the node earler. Your Final Node Affinity rule will look like the picture below. Confirm this is true and click *Save affinity rule*.

+
image::exercise4/04-image-affinity03.png[title="Node Affinity Rule", link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Now let's take a look at the Node Affinity rule on node-affinity-vm. You can view this information either through the GUI by navigating to node-affinity-vm → YAML, or by using the CLI..

+
[source,text,role=execute]
.View the VM definition
----
oc -n affinity get vm/node-affinity-vm -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.affinity}'
----

+
----
{"nodeAffinity":{"preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution":[{"preference":{"matchExpressions":[{"key":"zone","operator":"In","values":["east"]}]},"weight":75}]}}
----

+
. To make the VM follow these new affinity rules, you could migrate it to the node with the label. However, to show that this affinity rule is working we are going to power off the VM completely and then power it back on. 

+
. Click *Actions -> Stop*.

+
. Once the VM completely stops. Click *Actions -> Start*.

+
. The VM's relocation to the node with the assigned label is visible via the GUI. Alternatively, you can verify this change using the OCP CLI.

[#podaffinity]
== Pod Affinity
Pod Affinity is a scheduling rule that co-locates a VM Pod and an existing Pod (or another VM Pod) with a specific label onto the same node.

The primary benefit of using pod affinity is to improve performance for dependent VMs or services that require low-latency communication by guaranteeing their placement on the same worker node.

This lab will illustrate the setup and function of Pod Affinity.

+
. To begin, we need to apply a label to the *node-affinity-vm*. This will enable it to serve as the VM that our pod will have pod affinity to. The label can be added by editing the VM within the OpenShift CLI and including app: fedora

[#podantiaffinity]
== Pod Anti-Affinity

Pod Anti-affinity is a crucial feature for achieving High Availability (HA) in virtualized environments. It functions by instructing the scheduler to prevent the co-location of VM Pods on the same node if they possess a specific label.

The primary benefit of this rule is to enhance application resilience. For instance, by ensuring that VM Pods belonging to the same service (such as a database cluster) are distributed across different nodes, a failure in a single node will not cause an outage for the entire service.

This lab will guide you through setting up and demonstrating the functionality of Pod Anti-Affinity.

. Click the pod-affinity-vm

. Click Add expression under Workload labels

+
. Next, we will set a key and value to establish Pod Anti-affinity, ensuring this VM runs on a different node than node-affinity-vm. Set the key to app and the value to fedora. The resulting Pod Affinity rule should match the illustration provided below. Verify the rule's correctness, then click Save affinity rule.
